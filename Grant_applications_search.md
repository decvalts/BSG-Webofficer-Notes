# Making a new grant type visible in the Grant Applications search page (for admins only)

This relates to adding a new grant type, and then making that grant type searchable in the *Grant Applications* page, which is accessibly to site admins only for reviewing grant applications. 

This type of page is managed under what Drupal calls **Views**. To access, go to `Structure > Views > Grant Applications`. Edit the FILTER CRITERIA box (click on the `(Content)` link) to add more grant types to filter by.
