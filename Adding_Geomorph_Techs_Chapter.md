3. Use the search filter to filter by type: *Chapters*
4. Clicking *Title* in the search results will sort them numerically
5. All the chapters are pre-initialised, so to speak (See the appendix for adding a completely new chapter not listed)
6. Click 'edit' on the right hand side of the relevant chapter entry.
7. Add the PDF using the upload box.
8. Click save and then view the page (a placeholder page is created for each chapter)
9. Note the address of the PDF file by hovering over the link of the placeholder page. Copy it.

## Updating the menu link
Now we can update the menu link. (The one that appears under **Resources** from the home page)

10. From the Admin panel, navigate to `Structure > Menus > Online Publication`.
11. This page should display a list of all the chapters in their menu structure. Find your recently uploaded chapter.
12. Click the **edit** link under the **operations** column.
13. Now paste the hyperlink you copied in step 9. to the **Path** field.
14. Click save to make the changes.
15. You may need to wait for the page refresh overnight before others can see it. Alternatively, ask the Web Officer to do a page cache flush.
