# Adding Award Winners

After the awards at the BSG AGM, the award winners page will need to be modified.

This is done by creating a new "Award Winner"-type page. (`Content > Add Content > Winners`)

The check box marking the winner as Latest/Past will have to be check appropriately, and the previous years' winner will have to be updated to be marked as "Past winner" in order for the entries to display correctly on the Award Winners page.

Remember to keep the title in a similar format, e.g.:

Joe Bloggs (2017)

so each year appears consistent with the previous.
