# Front page

On the front page there are several items that can be edited. The overall layout is hard-coded into the site and cannot be changed from the Drupal admin side.

# Scrolling Banner/Minislider

This is where we put major news items or adverts for events like the AGM. It can be changed by adding new items under the `Minislider` content type. Note you have to remember to remove the old ones when they are done. Also, putting too much text in the description box 'stretches' the size of the box, so keep these fairly concise. (A dozen words or so).

# News listings

These are updated automatically from whatever is posted as a News Item content type.

# Twitter feed

Done automatically. Twitter integration is controlled via an API key that is inserted into the PHP code of the site. The keys are held by the Publications committee secretary. If this ever breaks you will need to liaise with the support ticket desk at Hydrant as it cannot be directly altered by us now.
