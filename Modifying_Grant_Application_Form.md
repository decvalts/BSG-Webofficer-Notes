# Overview
Navigate from the Admin panel to:

`Structure > Content Types > [GRANT NAME]`  Note: Not just plain `Grants` - this is not relevant at this stage.

The `MANAGE FIELDS` tab allows you to create new fields, and drag them around to reorder them.

Creating new fields requires you to set a field type. You must click save before creating another new field (Only one at a time).
Creating new fields will add new database fields too, so they must have unique names as well. 

# Field types
`Long text` is more apprpriate than `Text` for contnuous prose type entries.

# Operations 'Edit' Button
This allows further details to be added to the field. E.g. text length, helper text/guidance text, etc.

Remember to Save at each stage (It's not always easy to spot the wee save button)
