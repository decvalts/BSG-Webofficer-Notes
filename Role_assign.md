# Roles

Roles are used on the site to control who has access to certain sections of the website, and control who has access to certain functionality.

The main roles are:

Administrator - can change anything and everything. Only a few users have this privilege. The current webofficers and normally we keep the previous webofficers on this role as well to assist in handover. Hydrant support also have access to a test account.

Site Admin - can edit content of most pages. Most committee members will have this level of access. They see an admin panel, but with reduced functionality.

(Member Roles) - Various levels of membership roles, much more restricted in level of editing. (Basically only creation of Grant Applications and Award Nominations.)

## Changing role permissions

Role permissions are accessed via `People > Permissions` which will load a huge permissions matrix. (It can take a while to fully load.) You can modify from here which actions can be done by various roles. Normally this would be changed if, say, we wanted to change who could access certain grant types for example. 

## Role assign

Role assign is used to allow certain users to 'assign' other roles. Normally this is reserved to top level Administrators, but the Admin Assistant and BSG Secretary also have this permission, for changing and updating the membership when required.

(See `People > Permissions > Role Assign` for more details and the help page.)
